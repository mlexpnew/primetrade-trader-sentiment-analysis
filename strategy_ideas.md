Strategy 1: Risk control and selectivity during Fear periods
Business Logic Fear regimes are associated with:
* Lower average PnL
* Higher volatility and unstable outcomes
* Reduced trading activity and smaller position sizes
This indicates higher downside risk and lower predictability.
Rule of Thumb
* During Fear days, reduce overall trading exposure.
* Be more selective about who trades and how much.
Actionable Decisions
* Limit the number of trades executed per trader per day.
* Reduce average position sizes during Fear regimes.
* Prioritize frequent and historically consistent traders.
* Restrict or closely monitor infrequent traders, who show larger drawdowns in Fear periods.
Business Impact
* Protects capital during high-uncertainty regimes.
* Reduces volatility and drawdowns at the portfolio level.


Strategy 2: Controlled scaling during Greed periods
Business Logic Greed regimes show:
* Higher average PnL
* Increased trade frequency
* Larger position sizes
* Stronger long bias
This reflects higher risk appetite and better profit opportunities when managed carefully.
Rule of Thumb
* During Greed days, selectively increase exposure, not uniformly.
Actionable Decisions
* Allow higher trade frequency and moderately larger position sizes.
* Favor traders with:
    * Higher win rates
    * Consistent historical performance
* Encourage directional (long-biased) strategies aligned with sentiment.
Business Impact
* Captures upside during favorable market conditions.
* Prevents over-exposure by scaling only proven traders.
